ðŸ“© COLD MAIL GENERATOR

Cold email generator built with Groq, LangChain, and Streamlit â€” scrapes job postings from career pages and generates personalized outreach emails with relevant portfolio links.

ðŸ”¹ Detailed Repo Description

This tool automates the creation of cold emails for service-based companies. By entering a careers page URL, it extracts job listings and uses a vector database to match and insert relevant portfolio projects. The system then crafts tailored outreach emails, helping business development teams pitch their services more effectively.

For instance, if Nike is hiring a Principal Software Engineer, instead of going through costly recruitment, a company like Atliq can propose a dedicated engineer. A business development executive (e.g., Mohan) can use this tool to generate a personalized cold email showcasing Atliqâ€™s expertise instantly.
